# Boost - A Strategy for Green Travel
Under the current issues (COVID) and rising concerns over congestion of traffic and air pollution, we decided to make a website where users are allowed to book three different modes of transport (all while keeping price and helping the environment to ensure ease of mind):

- Using a Bus-Oriented System
- Using a Car-booking System (with preference for Electronic vehicles)
- Using Rent-able Bikes
All these can be accessed on our website by clicking the icons of the respective mode of transportation.

We displayed the respective fare amounts in accordance to the user's preferred mode of transport, with special attention to the growing increase in the traffic and as a result we have come up with several ideas.

Maximize the use of the electric vehicles within the website
Use a system where vehicles that are available to work alternate with odd numbered-license plates one day and the vehicles with even numbers on the next day in order to reduce the amount of vehicles on the road (thus maximizing our sustainability and also aid with less traffic
